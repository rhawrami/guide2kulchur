Since then, my stories have gotten (slightly) less depressing and (hopefully a lot?) more readable. Today, I write fantasy novels with a heaping dose of badass ladies and a big pinch of romance. When I'm not writing, I'm working at my day job in cybersecurity marketing, watching too many movies, or drawing. I live with my fiance, one very well behaved rabbit, one very poorly behaved rabbit, and one perpetually skeptical cat in Rhode Island.",

More recently, she moved from Africa with her husband and their four boys to the windswept moors of western England, where she gives in daily to her obsession to write. If not writing or reading, she will be collecting a worrying number of unusual and rather macabre plants, many of them poisonous as they tend to produce the most interestingly weird flowers. Shannon is the author of HER LITTLE FLOWERS and IN THE LONELY HOURS, available for purchase at all the usual retailers. Her upcoming title, GRIMDARK, is due for release on 29 July 2025.For further details to see Shannon's book news check out the links here:https://linktr.ee/shannonmorganauthor",

Her first novel, RIVER SING ME HOME (Headline, UK & Berkley, USA) is inspired by the true stories of the brave woman who went looking for their stolen children after the abolition of slavery in 1834. The novel draws on her time spent in the Caribbean, visiting family in St Lucia and Barbados. It was also informed by her Master's degree in Politics, where she focused on how slavery is remembered on the islands today. She travelled to the Caribbean and interviewed activists, historians and family members, and their reflections on what it really means to be free made her more determined than ever to bring the hidden stories of slavery to light.",

            "description": "Cassandra Clare was born to American parents in Tehran, Iran and spent much of her childhood travelling the world with her family, including one trek through the Himalayas as a toddler where she spent a month living in her father\u2019s backpack. She lived in France, England and Switzerland before she was ten years old.Since her family moved around so much she found familiarity in books and went everywhere with a book under her arm. She spent her high school years in Los Angeles where she used to write stories to amuse her classmates, including an epic novel called \u201cThe Beautiful Cassandra\u201d based on a Jane Austen short story of the same name (and which later inspired her current pen name).After college, Cassie lived in Los Angeles and New York where she worked at various entertainment magazines and even some rather suspect tabloids where she reported on Brad and Angelina\u2019s world travels and Britney Spears\u2019 wardrobe malfunctions. She started working on her YA novel, City of Bones, in 2004, inspired by the urban landscape of Manhattan, her favourite city. She turned to writing fantasy fiction full time in 2006 and hopes never to have to write about Paris Hilton again.Cassie\u2019s first professional writing sale was a short story called \u201cThe Girl\u2019s Guide to Defeating the Dark Lord\u201d in a Baen anthology of humor fantasy. Cassie hates working at home alone because she always gets distracted by reality TV shows and the antics of her cats, so she usually sets out to write in local coffee shops and restaurants. She likes to work in the company of her friends, who see that she sticks to her deadlines.City of Bones was her first novel. Sword Catcher is her most recent novel.",

Fourteen years later, Lewis wrote Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game (2003), in which he investigated the success of  Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics. His 2006 book The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game was his first to be adapted into a film, The Blind Side (2009). In 2010, he released The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine. The film adaptation of Moneyball was released in 2011, followed by The Big Short in 2015.Lewis's books have won two Los Angeles Times Book Prizes and several have reached number one on the New York Times Bestsellers Lists, including his most recent book, Going Infinite (2023).",

                "The love stories sold us the wrong thing. The best kind of love doesn\u2019t happen on moonlit walks and romantic vacations. It happens in between the folds of everyday life. It\u2019s not grand gestures that show how you feel, it\u2019s all the little secret things you do to make her life better that you never tell her about. Taking the end piece of the bread at breakfast so she can have the last middle piece for her sandwich when you pack her lunch. Making sure her car always has gas so she never has to stop at the pump. Telling her you\u2019re not cold and to take your jacket when you are in fact, very, very cold. It\u2019s watching TV on a rainy Sunday while you\u2019re doing laundry and turning her light off when she\u2019s fallen asleep reading. Sharing pizza crusts and laughing about something the kids did and taking care of each other when you\u2019re sick. It isn\u2019t glamorous, it isn\u2019t all butterflies and stars in your eyes. It\u2019s real. This is the kind of love that forever is made of. Because if it\u2019s this good when life is draining and mundane and hard, think of how wonderful it will be when the love songs are playing and the moon is out.",

I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because male scientists are particularly curious about What Women Want. Among studies on men, there\u2019s the now-famous bit about men tipping strippers more if they\u2019re ovulating\u2014they do, the effects are reproducible, and they go away if the woman is on birth control\u2014but that may or may not be scent related. (It\u2019s hard to say what you\u2019re smelling, exactly, in a strip club.) Men also prefer the smelly T-shirts of ovulating women, don\u2019t like the pit smells of menstruating women and women who are less immuno-compatible as much, and almost universally dislike the smell of a woman\u2019s tears, regardless of her reproductive status.",
                "Primatologists have seen this many times in the field: Say a male is fighting with another male. The females largely ignore the conflict, so long as it doesn\u2019t bother them or their children. But then one of the combatants goes off and picks up a baby, who blithely clings to his chest hair or his back. Then he goes over to the male he was having the fight with. If the baby likes the male it\u2019s clinging to, the kid will scream at his opponent if he acts aggressively. So the other male either backs off or is mobbed by friends of the mother, spurred on by the baby\u2019s cries. It\u2019s so effective, in fact, that some males simply carry a baby around as a kind of adorable bodyguard, preventing fights before they start."

            "description": "Stephen Edwin King was born the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his father left them when Stephen was two, he and his older brother, David, were raised by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford, Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury, had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by her sisters to take over the physical care of them. Other family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support. After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally challenged.Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and Lisbon Falls High School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated in 1970, with a B.A. in English and qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.He met Tabitha Spruce in the stacks of the Fogler Library at the University, where they both worked as students; they married in January of 1971. As Stephen was unable to find placement as a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.Stephen made his first professional short story sale (\"The Glass Floor\") to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many were gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other anthologies.In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching English at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories and to work on novels.",

She lived in France, England and Switzerland before she was ten years old.Since her family moved around so much she found familiarity in books and went everywhere with a book under her arm. She spent her high school years in Los Angeles where she used to write stories to amuse her classmates, including an epic novel called \u201cThe Beautiful Cassandra\u201d based on a Jane Austen short story of the same name (and which later inspired her current pen name).After college, Cassie lived in Los Angeles and New York where she worked at various entertainment magazines and even some rather suspect tabloids where she reported on Brad and Angelina\u2019s world travels and Britney Spears\u2019 wardrobe malfunctions. She started working on her YA novel, City of Bones, in 2004, inspired by the urban landscape of Manhattan, her favourite city. She turned to writing fantasy fiction full time in 2006 and hopes never to have to write about Paris Hilton again.Cassie\u2019s first professional writing sale was a short story called \u201cThe Girl\u2019s Guide to Defeating the Dark Lord\u201d in a Baen anthology of humor fantasy. Cassie hates working at home alone because she always gets distracted by reality TV shows and the antics of her cats, so she usually sets out to write in local coffee shops and restaurants. She likes to work in the company of her friends, who see that she sticks to her deadlines.City of Bones was her first novel. Sword Catcher is her most recent novel.",

            "description": "Brad Meltzer is the Emmy-nominated, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Lightning Rod, The Escape Artist, and eleven other bestselling thrillers. He also writes non-fiction books like The JFK Conspiracy, about a secret plot to kill JFK before he was sworn in \u2013 and the Ordinary People Change the World kids book series, which he does with Chris Eliopoulos and inspired the PBS KIDS TV show, Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum. His newest kids books are We are the Beatles, We are the Beatles, and I am Simone Biles. His newest inspirational book is Make Magic, based on his viral commencement address.In addition to his fiction, Brad is one of the only authors to ever have books on the bestseller list for Non-Fiction (The Nazi Conspiracy), Advice (Heroes for My Son and Heroes for My Daughter), Children\u2019s Books (I Am Amelia Earhart and I Am Abraham Lincoln) and even comic books (Justice League of America), for which he won the prestigious Eisner Award.He is also the host of Brad Meltzer\u2019s Lost History and Brad Meltzer\u2019s Decoded on the History Channel, and is responsible for helping find the missing 9/11 flag that the firefighters raised at Ground Zero, making national news on the 15th anniversary of 9/11. Meltzer unveiled the flag at the 9/11 Museum in New York, where it is now on display. See the video here. The Hollywood Reporter recently put him on their list of Hollywood\u2019s 25 Most Powerful Authors.He also recently delivered the commencement address at the University of Michigan, in front of 70,000 people, including his graduating son. Entitled Make Magic and called \u201cone of the best commencement addresses of all time,\u201d it\u2019s been shared millions of times across social media. Do yourself a favor, watch it here and buy the book here.For sure, it\u2019s tough to find anyone being so successful in so many different mediums of the popular culture. But why does Brad thrive in all these different professions? His belief that ordinary people change the world. It is that core belief that runs through every one of his projects.His newest thriller, The Lightning Rod, brings back characters Nola and Zig in a setting that will blow your mind (you won't believe where the government let Brad go). For now, we'll say this: What's the one secret no one knows about you? It's about to come out. Nearly 2,000 five-star reviews. Raves by everyone from the Wall Street Journal, to James Patterson, to Brad's mother-in-law. Plus that twist at the end! And yes, the new Zig & Nola thriller is coming soon!His newest non-fiction book, The JFK Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill Kennedy -- and Why It Failed, which he wrote with Josh Mensch, is a true story about a secret assassination plot to kill JFK at the start of his Presidency and, if successful, would\u2019ve changed history. His illustrated children\u2019s books I Am Amelia Earhart and I Am Abraham Lincoln, which he does with artist Chris Eliopoulos, were written for his own children, to give them better heroes to look up to. Try them. You won\u2019t believe how inspired you and your family will be. Some of our favorites in the series are I am Mister Rogers and I am Dolly Parton.His other non-fiction books, Heroes for My Son and Heroes for My Daughter, are collections of heroes \u2013 from Jim Henson to Sally Ride \u2014 that he\u2019s been working on since the day his kids were born and is on sale now, as well as History Decoded: The 10 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time.He\u2019s also one of the co-creators of the TV show, Jack & Bobby.Raised in Brooklyn and Miami, Brad is a graduate of the University of Michigan and Columbia Law School. The Tenth Justice was his first published work and became an instant New York Times bestseller. Dead Even followed a year later and also hit the New York Times bestseller list, as have all thirteen of his novels. The First Counsel came next, which was about a White House lawyer dating the President\u2019s daughter, then The Millionaires, which was about two brothers who",

            "description": "Abraham Verghese, MD, MACP, is Professor for the Theory and Practice of Medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine and Senior Associate Chair of the Department of Internal Medicine.Born of Indian parents who were teachers in Ethiopia, he grew up near Addis Ababa and began his medical training there. When Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed, he completed his training at Madras Medical College and went to the United States for his residency as one of many foreign medical graduates. Like many others, he found only the less popular hospitals and communities open to him, an experience he described in one of his early New Yorker articles, The Cowpath to America.From Johnson City, Tennessee, where he was a resident from 1980 to 1983, he did his fellowship at Boston University School of Medicine, working at Boston City Hospital for two years. It was here that he first saw the early signs of the HIV epidemic and later, when he returned to Johnson City as an assistant professor of medicine, he saw the second epidemic, rural AIDS, and his life took the turn for which he is most well known ? his caring for numerous AIDS patients in an era when little could be done and helping them through their early and painful deaths was often the most a physician could do.His work with terminal patients and the insights he gained from the deep relationships he formed and the suffering he saw were intensely transformative; they became the basis for his first book, My Own Country : A Doctor's Story, written later during his years in El Paso, Texas. Such was his interest in writing that he decided to take some time away from medicine to study at the Iowa Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa, where he earned a Master of Fine Arts degree in 1991. Since then, his writing has appeared in The New Yorker, Texas Monthly, Atlantic, The New York Times, The New York Times Magazine, Granta, Forbes.com, and The Wall Street Journal, among others.Following Iowa, he became professor of medicine and chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Texas Tech Health Sciences Center in El Paso, Texas, where he lived for the next 11 years. In addition to writing his first book, which was one of five chosen as Best Book of the Year by Time magazine and later made into a Mira Nair movie, he also wrote a second best-selling book, The Tennis Partner : A Story of Friendship and Loss, about his friend and tennis partner?s struggle with addiction. This was a New York Times' Notable Book.",

            "description": "Sir Ahmed Salman Rushdie is an Indian-born British and American novelist. His work often combines magic realism with historical fiction and primarily deals with connections, disruptions, and migrations between Eastern and Western civilizations, typically set on the Indian subcontinent. Rushdie's second novel, Midnight's Children (1981), won the Booker Prize in 1981 and was deemed to be \"the best novel of all winners\" on two occasions, marking the 25th and the 40th anniversary of the prize.After his fourth novel, The Satanic Verses (1988), Rushdie became the subject of several assassination attempts and death threats, including a fatwa calling for his death issued by  Ruhollah Khomeini, the supreme leader of Iran. In total, 20 countries banned the book. Numerous killings and bombings have been carried out by extremists who cite the book as motivation, sparking a debate about censorship and religiously motivated violence. In 2022, Rushdie survived a stabbing at the Chautauqua Institution in Chautauqua, New York.In 1983, Rushdie was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He was appointed a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France in 1999. Rushdie was knighted in 2007 for his services to literature. In 2008, The Times ranked him 13th on its list of the 50 greatest British writers since 1945. Since 2000, Rushdie has lived in the United States. He was named Distinguished Writer in Residence at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute of New York University in 2015. Earlier, he taught at Emory University. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2012, he published Joseph Anton: A Memoir, an account of his life in the wake of the events following The Satanic Verses. Rushdie was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time magazine in April 2023.Rushdie's personal life, including his five marriages and four divorces, has attracted notable media attention and controversies, particularly during his marriage to actress  Padma Lakshmi.",

That there were millions of Asian girls like me out there in the world, starring in their own dramas large and small, had not yet occurred to me, as I had neither lived nor seen it.",
                "As my thoughts reached out to them, all at once I could envision hundreds of gossamer-thin threads of history and love, curiosity and memory, built up slowly across the time and space between us\u2014a web of connections too delicate to be seen or touched, too strong to be completely severed.",
                "so when people asked me about my family, my features, the fate I\u2019d been dealt, maybe it isn\u2019t surprising how I answered \u2014 first in a childish, cheerful chirrup, later in the lecturing tone of one obliged to educate. I arrive to be calm and direct, never giving anything away in my voice, never changing the details. Offering the story I\u2019d learned so early was, I thought, one way to gain acceptance. It was both the excuse for how I looked, and a way of asking pardon for it."

It's not a game you don't understand the rules of, or a test you never got the materials to study for. It never leaves you wondering who could possibly be texting at 3 am. Or what you could possibly do to make it come home and stay there. It's fucking boring, dude. I don't walk around mired in uneasiness, waiting for the other shoe to drop. No parsing through spun tales about why it took her so long to come back from the store. No checking her emails or calling her job to make sure she's actually there. No sitting in my car outside her house at dawn, to make sure she's alone when she leaves. This feels safe, and steadfast, and predictable. And secure. It's boring as shit. And it's easily the best thing I've ever felt.",

She splits her time between London and Ramsgate on the coast of Kent, so that she never has to go too long without seeing the sea.As the granddaughter of Caribbean immigrants who came to the UK as part of the Windrush Generation, Eleanor has always been drawn to Caribbean history. Her first novel, RIVER SING ME HOME (Headline, UK & Berkley, USA) is inspired by the true stories of the brave woman who went looking for their stolen children after the abolition of slavery in 1834. The novel draws on her time spent in the Caribbean, visiting family in St Lucia and Barbados. It was also informed by her Master's degree in Politics, where she focused on how slavery is remembered on the islands today. She travelled to the Caribbean and interviewed activists, historians and family members, and their reflections on what it really means to be free made her more determined than ever to bring the hidden stories of slavery to light.",

            "description": "KATE MORTON is an award-winning, New York Times and Sunday Times bestselling author. Her seven novels - The House at Riverton, The Forgotten Garden, The Distant Hours, The Secret Keeper, The Lake House, The Clockmaker's Daughter, and Homecoming - are published in over 45 countries, in 38 languages, and have all been number one bestsellers around the world. Kate Morton was born in South Australia, grew up in the mountains of south-east Queensland, and now lives with her family in London and Australia. She has degrees in dramatic art and English literature, and harboured dreams of joining the Royal Shakespeare Company until she realised that it was words she loved more than performing. Kate still feels a pang of longing each time she goes to the theatre and the house lights dim.\"I fell deeply in love with books as a child and believe that reading is freedom; that to read is to live a thousand lives in one; that fiction is a magical conversation between two people - you and me - in which our minds meet across time and space. I love books that conjure a world around me, bringing their characters and settings to life, so that the real world disappears and all that matters, from beginning to end, is turning one more page.\"You can find more information about Kate Morton and her books at https://www.katemorton.com or connect on http://www.facebook.com/KateMortonAuthor or instagram.com/katemortonauthor/ To stay up-to-date on Kate's books and events, join her mailing list here: https://www.katemorton.com/mailing-list/",

Never stop noticing things like a bus driver opening and closing a door from way past her reach. Don\u2019t worry too much about show and tell \u2013 toys and lunch boxes don\u2019t make you happy and some people are fibbing. Just try to get some laughs. If you\u2019re scared about something you\u2019ve never done before like reading or multiplication or dating, say this: I\u2019ll figure it out. Then, remind yourself of everything you\u2019ve figured out so far. It\u2019s okay if it takes you a while to make friends \u2013 you\u2019ll better appreciate what a friend is worth. As you grow, so will your world. And the bigger your world, the more people will hear your story and say, I know how you feel. In the meantime, hold on tight to your Joanies, Billys, Finns, Lauries, and Sades. And never forget this \u2013 all the great laughs come from the minds of misfits.",

The academic field of history is dominated by white men handicapped by the inability to see whiteness\u2019s impact on America\u2019s biography. The best historians try to approximate the truth by unbending the collection of funhouse mirrors through which the past has been viewed, but it isn\u2019t simply a counterfeit version of history, it is a fable that erases the reflection of an entire people to ensure that the mythology of the heroes lives happily ever after.",
                "That \"anti-white\" sentiment people keep talking about is just the erosion of what I call the \"privilege of individuality.\" White people aren't accustomed to being lumped together and being defined by the actions of others. Welcome to the club.(7/16/2020 on Twitter)"

It is where our identity takes root and blossoms, where as children, we imagine, play, and question, and as adolescents, we retreat and try. As we grow older, we hope to settle into a place to raise a family or pursue work. When we try to understand ourselves, we often begin by considering the kind of home in which we were raised."

He gained national prominence with The Soul of a New Machine (1981), a Pulitzer Prize-winning account of computer engineers at Data General, noted for its insight into the emerging tech industry and the human stories behind innovation. He later earned widespread praise for Mountains Beyond Mountains (2003), a biography of physician and humanitarian  Paul Farmer, which further solidified his reputation for blending compelling storytelling with social relevance.Kidder studied English at Harvard and earned his MFA from the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop. Though his first book, The Road to Yuba City, was a critical failure, he rebounded with a series of successful works exploring diverse topics: home construction (House), elementary education (Among Schoolchildren), and aging (Old Friends). He also served in Vietnam, though he says the war did not significantly shape his writing, despite authoring several well-regarded essays on the topic.In 2010, Kidder became the first A. M. Rosenthal Writer-in-Residence at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center. There, he co-wrote Good Prose, a book on nonfiction writing. His work continues to be recognized for its empathy, narrative strength, and commitment to truth.",

It wasn't until I received a Kindle for Christmas one year that my world completely flipped upside down. When looking for books I came across the Contemporary Romance genre and was sold and I haven't turned back since. You can either find my head buried in my Kindle, listening to inspiring heart ripping music or typing away on the computer twisting and turning the lives of my characters while driving my readers crazy with anticipation.\u200bI currently reside in beautiful Colorado Springs where the sun is always shining and there is a trail waiting to be hiked on every corner.

            "description": "I\u2019m Brandon Sanderson, and I write stories of the fantastic: fantasy, science fiction, and thrillers.Defiant, the fourth and final volume of the series that started with Skyward in 2018, comes out in November 2023, capping an already book-filled year that will see the releases of all four Secret Projects: Tress of the Emerald Sea, The Frugal Wizard\u2019s Handbook for Surviving Medieval England, Yumi and the Nightmare Painter, and Secret Project Four (with its official title reveal coming October 2023). These four books were all initially offered to backers of the #1 Kickstarter campaign of all time.November 2022 saw the release of The Lost Metal, the seventh volume in the Mistborn saga, and the final volume of the Mistborn Era Two featuring Wax & Wayne. The third era of Mistborn is slated to be written after the first arc of the Stormlight Archive wraps up.In November 2020 we saw the release of Rhythm of War\u2014the fourth massive book in the New York Times #1 bestselling Stormlight Archive series that began with The Way of Kings\u2014and Dawnshard (book 3.5), a novella set in the same world that bridges the gaps between the main releases. This series is my love letter to the epic fantasy genre, and it\u2019s the type of story I always dreamed epic fantasy could be. The fifth volume, Wind and Truth, is set for release in fall 2024.Most readers have noticed that my adult fantasy novels are in a connected universe called the Cosmere. This includes The Stormlight Archive, both Mistborn series, Elantris, Warbreaker, and various novellas available on Amazon, including The Emperor\u2019s Soul, which won a Hugo Award in 2013. In November 2016 all of the existing Cosmere short fiction was released in one volume called Arcanum Unbounded. If you\u2019ve read all of my adult fantasy novels and want to see some behind-the-scenes information, that collection is a must-read.I also have three YA series: The Rithmatist (currently at one book), The Reckoners (a trilogy beginning with Steelheart), and Skyward. For young readers I also have my humorous series Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians, which had its final book, Bastille vs. the Evil Librarians, come out in 2022. Many of my adult readers enjoy all of those books as well, and many of my YA readers enjoy my adult books, usually starting with Mistborn.Additionally, I have a few other novellas that are more on the thriller/sci-fi side. These include the Legion series, as well as Perfect State and Snapshot. There\u2019s a lot of material to go around!Good starting places are Mistborn (a.k.a. The Final Empire), Skyward, Steelheart,The Emperor\u2019s Soul, and Alcatraz vs. the Evil Librarians. If you\u2019re already a fan of big fat fantasies, you can jump right into The Way of Kings.I was also honored to be able to complete the final three volumes of The Wheel of Time, beginning with The Gathering Storm, using Robert Jordan\u2019s notes.Sample chapters from all of my books are available at brandonsanderson.com\u2014and check out the rest of my site for chapter-by-chapter annotations, deleted scenes, and more.",

At one point, he talked about something he noticed, not only in himself, but in his queer friends and comcommunity\u2014this way in which queer people tend to make themselves indispensable in their relationships and friendships. They\u2019re so afraid of being left that they make themselves unleavable.",
                "You all know I\u2019m queer, but I still have to play the cool hijabi[\u2026] The not too religious hijabi, the hijabi who can rock it with the alternative crowd, who won\u2019t judge you, who will be accepting and tolerant, the Good Muslim. I\u2019m in full on silent rant mode now. Unlike those Bad Muslims, the religious ones, the ones who are inconvenient in their practice, the ones you have to pause for as they break their fasts, the ones who have to step out to pray. The marginalized ones you would fight for, organize for, protest for, but would never be friends with, who you would studiously avoid at a brunch. I\u2019m the cool hijabi only because you\u2019re projecting your xenophobic narrow-mindedness, your lack of imagination of Muslims into me. You\u2019re still projecting them. Your prejudices are still in the room. ",
                "This better world\u2014that is the world I\u2019m fighting for from inside the whale, this world I want to be birthed into. A world that is kinder, more generous, more just. A world that takes care of the marginalized, the poor, the sick. Where wealth and resources are redistributed, where reparations are made for the harms of history, where stolen land is given back. Where the environment is cared for and respected, and all species are cared for and respected. Where conflicts are dealt with in gentleness. Where people take care of each other and feel empowered to be their truest selves. Where anger is allowed and joy is allowed and fun is allowed and quietness is allowed and loudness is allowed and being wrong is allowed and everything, everything, everything is rooted in love. And maybe that\u2019s an unattainable utopia.But I\u2019ve found a few smaller versions of this world\u2014in the ground rules Liv and I set on the bus en route to meeting my family; in the grace Cara showed me when I came out to her; in the patience with which Zu mentored me. I\u2019m not na\u00efve enough to think we\u2019ll reach this utopia in my lifetime or possibly ever, but I\u2019m also not faithless enough to think that the direction in which I strive doesn\u2019t matter, that these smaller versions of the world aren\u2019t leading us there."

The Take (2004), a documentary film about Argentine workers' self-managed factories, written by her and directed by her husband  Avi Lewis, further increased her profile. The Shock Doctrine (2007), a critical analysis of the history of neoliberal economics, solidified her standing as a prominent activist on the international stage and was adapted into a six-minute companion film by  Alfonso Cuaron and  Jon\u00e1s Cuar\u00f3n, as well as a feature-length documentary by  Michael Winterbottom. Klein's This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate (2014) was a New York Times nonfiction bestseller and the winner of the Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction.In 2016, Klein was awarded the Sydney Peace Prize for her activism on climate justice. Klein frequently appears on global and national lists of top influential thinkers, including the 2014 Thought Leaders ranking compiled by the Gottlieb Duttweiler Institute, Prospect magazine's world thinkers 2014 poll, and Maclean's 2014 Power List. She was formerly a member of the board of directors of the climate activist group 350.org.",

For strictly peaceful energy generation, he added, and underlined the point by inviting survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Venezuela. Foreign media took it seriously, producing froth in Washington. Ch\u00e1vez with nukes! In reality, Venezuela\u2019s scientific establishment was hollowed, the once prestigious Institute for Scientific Research a husk. Physicists were emigrating, and the country\u2019s only reactor, a small research facility, had closed from neglect. After a tsunami wrecked Japan\u2019s Fukushima nuclear plant in March 2011, Ch\u00e1vez closed the curtain on his atomic theater, solemnly halting development for safety reasons and urging other countries to follow his lead in protecting humanity. It is something extremely risky and dangerous for the whole world.",

He asked about the president\u2019s plan to integrate decision making across state agencies. Blank looks. He asked about his transport recommendations. Silence. He asked for responses to his studies on infrastructure and finance. There weren\u2019t any. When Rosenhead challenged Giordani over the information vacuum, his friend smiled enigmatically and said such was a consultant\u2019s fate. No feedback, none at all, said Rosenhead. Quite extraordinary. This is the only place where this happens. The professor said he had heard rumors the country\u2019s infrastructure was in trouble. I get the impression Ch\u00e1vez has applied the concepts of operational research in ways I would not. He paused and sipped his rum. Maybe if it was a more organized country, operational research would work here."

Welcome to my page.I'm the author of books for adults and children, including Emily Wilde's Encyclopaedia of Faeries, Even the Darkest Stars, Ember and the Ice Dragons, The School Between Winter and Fairyland, and more.I'm only occasionally on Goodreads, so if you want a more reliable way to get in contact with me, I'd recommend using social media (I'm on Instagram and Facebook) or the contact form on my website.Review policy: I only review books that I love, which is why you'll only see 4 and 5 star reviews here. Because readers often ask me about my favourite books and authors, I'm aiming to use this page as a place to collect all of my recommendations.Also, I am NOT the author of More Than a Mom: Living a Full And Balanced Life When Your Child Has Special Needs. I've asked Goodreads to remove it from my page several times but it keeps getting re-added. If you have questions about this title, please direct them to the other Heather Fawcett!",

                "If there is something you take away from these pages, let it be that God is passionately, personally concerned with every small hurt or inconvenience in your life, and you should talk to him about whatever you want, whether it is a real estate deal or a broken washing machine. What happens, though\u2014what certainly happened to me\u2014is that in thinking about how God cares about the humdrum business of your day, you start to fall more in love with him and less in love with the thing you started praying about in the first place. That\u2019s the best possible scenario, if for no other reason than you are a little less stressed out.",
                "The whole crux of the Christian faith is that we cannot save ourselves... I know that I can't fix the brokenness inside me or overcome my own sin. For people who don't share my faith, this sounds totally depressing, I know. And entire self-help sections of bookstores tell you otherwise, I know this too. For some reason it is easier to believe that we can muscle our way to better, more fulfilled selves, rather than accept that we are hopelessly flawed and all of those efforts are going to be temporary. It doesn't mean we are idiots. Or weaklings. We know the phone number. We stay on the block when we are lost. We use the tools God gave us: brains and senses of humor. But ultimately, we cannot always find our way back when we are lost. He has to come get us."

So has forbidden her romance. When our talented and spirited Jewish teenager falls in love with the dashing Catholic poet, Jean Jausion, they find acceptance only at the famed Caf\u00e9 de Flore, whose habitues include: Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, Pablo Picasso, Django Reinhardt, and other luminaries of the Latin Quarter\u2019s creative world. Their parents are against the match and so are the Nazis.999 - The Extraordinary Young Women of the First Official Jewish Transport to Auschwitz brings together stories of girls on the first transport along with historic research that will astound new fans and former fans of Rena's Promise. 999 places the young women of the first transport front and center in Holocaust history and women's history, and I am hugely excited about the reception it is already having\u2014you will meet Edith, who is very much like, Rena (vivacious, generous and compassionate). You can find more on our Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/999themovie/Or subscribe to the 999 newsletter by visiting: https://www.999thebook.com/Sadly, Edith passed away two weeks after her 96th birthday this year (2020). A short memorial is on Youtube: https://youtu.be/X_eRoFu_8SkYou can also find my Vlog on the Rena's Promise YouTube Channel and follow some of my journeys to Auschwitz, Slovakia and Tylicz, Poland. That channel started as a desire to fight Holocaust denial by promoting truth and helped spur the rebirth of Rena's Promise: The Story of Sisters in Auschwitz and made the digital edition an Amazon BEST-SELLING Holocaust Memoir for 6 months in 2012. Since then a new edition of Rena\u2019s Promise has been released, as well as an audio book. RP has been translated into Japanese, Turkish, Portuguese, Dutch, German and published in the UK and commonwealth. The website for RenasPromise.com offers teachers free curriculum on innovative ways to teach the Holocaust and provides a map called the Promise Project that shows where girls from the first transport lived and the towns they were deported from. My novel, The Weeping Buddha, was released by Akashic Books in 2003. I really want to write fiction, but even this murder mystery is based in part on my attempt to deal with an unsolved mystery in my life. It was a finalist in the Nero Wolf Awards and Best Mystery, Lambda Awards (2004).While NPR doesn\u2019t seem to do commentaries anymore, you can find some of my quirky essays in the archives of ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Additionally, I have been published in The New York Times, National Geographic, Newsweek, Marie Claire, The Guardian, The Daily Mail, YOU Magazine (Sunday Supplement to Mail on Sunday), The Advocate and Racing Home: Short Stories By Award-Winning North Carolina Writers.",
