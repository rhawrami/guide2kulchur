Hello there. This script allows you to scrape Goodreads Annual Choice Awards book data for a collection
of years. The data collected will be placed in the 'data/goodreads-choice-awards/books/' directory. For a preview of
what the awards look like, please use this link: https://www.goodreads.com/choiceawards/best-books-2024

To begin, please enter the collection of award years you'd like to scrape. NB:

- Award data is available from 2011 to 2024, as of {time.ctime()}.
- Separate the years by a space; press Enter when you are done.

Scraping process completed; as a final message, I leave you with an excerpt from JÃ¼nger's Storm of Steel:

"That was the final winnings in a game on which so often all had been staked: the nation was no longer for me 
an empty thought veiled in symbols; and how could it have been otherwise when I had seen so many die for its sake, 
and been schooled myself to stake my life for its credit every minute, day and night, without a thought? And so, 
strange as it may sound, I learned from this very four years' schooling in force and in all the fantastic extravagance 
of material warfare that life had no depth of meaning except when it is pledged for an ideal, and that there are ideals in 
comparison with which the life of an individual and even of a people has no weight. And though the aim for which I fought as an 
individual, as an atom in the whole body of the army, was not to be achieved, though material force cast us, apparently, to the 
earth, yet we learned once and for all to stand for a cause and if necessary to fall as befitted men."
